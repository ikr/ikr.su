        Resumé
    </h1>
    <p>
        My name is <strong>Ivan Krechetov</strong>, and I am a <strong>programmer</strong>. I was born in <strong>1979</strong>, in Novosibirsk, <strong>Russia</strong>. I live in Winterthur, <strong>Switzerland</strong> with my family: a wife and two daughters. I’m fluent in English, and can speak and write casual German.
    </p>

        Early years
    </h2>
    <p>
        Before I was 11 I didn’t even care if computers exist. Then, one day I randomly stumbled upon a book about BASIC, the programming language. <em>And then it began…</em> I was totally blown away by the idea that I could create my own worlds in code. I was eager to build smart, beautiful things, which are able to make their own decisions, and be… alive, sort of.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was a constant creativity bliss: all those small programs and games I made and hardly really finished — because I was only 12, and because new shiny ideas appeared faster than I could code. Since the very beginning I had no doubts at all that <strong>I’ll be coding all my life</strong>.

    <p>
        I’ve obtained a <strong>Bachelor’s degree</strong> from <a href="http://www.nsu.ru">Novosibirsk State University</a> (NSU), graduated with honors, with <strong>100% excellent</strong> grades in the diploma, which makes me <strong>one of the top-2% students</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I studied at the department of mechanics and mathematics. We had <em>a lot</em> of <strong>Math</strong>: mathematical analysis, theory of functions of a complex variable, mathematical logic, abstract algebra, computation methods, discrete mathematics, probability and statistics, you name it. Basically, the curriculum was: all the Math imaginable + gym class.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the last two years I did the research work at the chair of programming. My qualification work subject was “Forming the object-oriented data structures tailor-made for the search tasks”. In essence that was a rather simplistic exploration of how one would go about building an <strong>object-oriented database</strong>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="20012003">
        2001—2003
    </h3>
    <p>
        I continued at NSU, the same department and chair, and obtained a <strong>Master’s degree</strong>, again <strong>with honors</strong>; however, the grades weren’t that maxed-out anymore, as I already had in parallel a full-time job. My master’s thesis subject was: “Effective RDBMS usage in an object-oriented application” — exploration on the topic of <strong>object-relational mapping</strong>. Regarding the curriculum, it was more of the <strong>computer science</strong>-related courses than during the bachelor’s program.

        I worked as a <strong>PhD Associate</strong> at the <a href="http://trese.cs.utwente.nl/">University of Twente</a> in Enschede, The <strong>Netherlands</strong>. My subject was: “Aspectual Refactoring of Software Architectures” — research in the field of <strong>aspect-oriented</strong> software development: <strong>separation of concerns</strong>, architectural aspects, architectural styles, software architecture design process, formalized evaluation and refactoring.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, PhD research work didn’t quite meet my expectations. It was too much of writing papers, and too little (almost none) of writing code. While, of course, the educational value was great, and I definitely learned a lot. Thus, in spite of rather promising initial results, I have <strong>quit</strong> the PhD in favor of a programming job in Switzerland.

        Worked as a junior programmer on <em>ActiveFrame</em> and it’s applications. ActiveFrame was a framework for the development of <strong>document flow</strong> support programs, which require rich data management. My part was the code generator, and the enhancement of some of the object-oriented database features. The ActiveFrame application I maintained most of the time was a customer contacts management program.

        A custom Web applications development <a href="http://www.xiag.ch">company</a>. That was my first, and hopefully the last, experience as a <strong>manager</strong>. Not writing any production code for over a year was <em>physically</em> painful in the end. However, I believe I did a pretty decent job as a manager. I controlled multiple projects’ progress, communicated with customers, and translated their concerns into engineers’ tasks, evaluated the results, prepared the project proposals for potential customers, wrote specifications, interviewed job candidates.
    </p>
    <p>
        After about a year I became desperate for coding. But I lacked the experience at the time with Web programming, and wasn’t much inspired by PHP4 language. Luckily, we found a C++ project for me: a <strong>digital photo prints</strong> <a href="http://en.ifolor.ch/ordering_software_en_ch.Ifolor?ActiveID=1388">ordering software</a> for Microsoft Windows. It had a custom look, simple image enhancement features, ordering Web GUI integration via an embedded Internet Explorer, network communication with the server for the photos upload, writing orders to CD/DVD for sending by post. When released, it was downloaded and <strong>used by tens of thousands of people</strong>.
