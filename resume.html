	<h1 id="curriculum_vit">Resumé</h1>

	<p>My name is <strong>Ivan Krechetov</strong>. I was born in <strong>1979</strong>, in Novosibirsk, <strong>Russia</strong>. I live in
	Winterthur, <strong>Switzerland</strong>, with my family: a wife and two daughters.</p>

	<h2 id="early_years">Early years</h2>

	<p>Before I was 11 I didn’t even care if computers exist. Then, one day I randomly stumbled upon a book
	about BASIC, the programming language. <em>And then it began…</em> I was totally blown away by the idea
	that I could create my own worlds in code. I was eager to build smart, beautiful things, which are
	able to make their own decisions, and be… alive, sort of.</p>

	<p>It was a constant creativity bliss: all those small programs and games I made and hardly ever really
	finished — because I was only 12, and because new shiny ideas appeared faster than I could code.
	Since the very beginning I had no doubts at all that <strong>I&#8217;ll be coding all my life</strong>.</p>

	<h2 id="education">Education</h2>

	<h3 id="19962001">1996–2001</h3>

	<p>I&#8217;ve obtained a <strong>Bachelor&#8217;s degree</strong> from <a href="http://www.nsu.ru">Novosibirsk State University</a> (NSU),
	having graduated with honors, with <strong>100% excellent</strong> grades in the diploma, which makes me <strong>one of
	the top-2% students</strong>.</p>

	<p>I studied at the department of mechanics and mathematics. We had <em>a lot</em> of Math: mathematical
	analysis, theory of functions of a complex variable, mathematical logic, abstract algebra,
	computation methods, discrete mathematics, probability and statistics, you name it. Basically, the
	curriculum was: all the Math imaginable + gym class.</p>

	<p>In the last two years I was doing a research at the chair of programming. My qualification work
	subject was “Forming the object-oriented data structures tailor-made for the search tasks”. In
	essence that was a rather simplistic exploration of how one would go about building an
	object-oriented database.</p>

	<h3 id="20012003">2001–2003</h3>

	<p>I continued at NSU, the same department and chair, and obtained a <strong>Master&#8217;s degree</strong>, again
	<strong>with honors</strong>; however, the grades weren&#8217;t that maxed-out anymore, as I already had in parallel a
	full-time job. My master&#8217;s thesis subject was: “Effective RDBMS usage in an object-oriented
	application”. Regarding the curriculum, it was more of the computer science-related courses
	than during the bachelor&#8217;s program.</p>

	<p>I worked as a <strong>PhD Associate</strong> at the <a href="http://trese.cs.utwente.nl/">University of Twente</a> in
	Enschede, The <strong>Netherlands</strong>. My subject was: “Aspectual Refactoring of Software Architectures”,
	research in the field of aspect-oriented software development: separation of concerns, architectural
	aspects, architectural styles, software architecture design process, formalized evaluation and
	refactoring.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, PhD research work didn&#8217;t quite meet my expectations. It was too much of writing
	papers, and too little (almost none) of writing code. While, of course, the educational value was
	great, and I definitely learned a lot. Thus, in spite of rather promising initial results, I have
	quitted the PhD in favor of a programming job in Switzerland.</p>

	<h2 id="professional_experience">Professional Experience</h2>

	<h3 id="march_2000september_2000_glance_ag_zrich">March 2000–September 2000: Glance AG, Zürich</h3>

	<p>Worked as a junior programmer on <em>ActiveFrame</em> and it&#8217;s applications. ActiveFrame was a framework
	for the development of document automation support programs, which require rich data management. My
	part was the code generator, and the enhancement of some of the object-oriented database features.
	The ActiveFrame application I maintained most of the time was a customer contacts management
	program.</p>

	<p>Left the position because of a limited period of the Swiss work permit L.</p>

	<p>Tech: <strong>C++</strong>, Win32, MFC, Oracle 8.</p>

	<p>The company is known for creating <a href="http://www.ricardo.ch">ricardo.ch</a>. However, I wasn&#8217;t in Ricardo
	team, but rather working on something that was supposed to become “the next big thing” for
	the company, but never actually has: <a href="http://www.wetellyou.com/">WeTellYou.com</a> — a global expert
	advice system, meant to provide a communication platform for people asking questions and giving
	answers — by e-Mail, Chat and Telephone. In addition the site supplied IP-telephony and billing,
	WAP and PDA adaptations.</p>

	<p>I was responsible for the data layer, programmed the chat client, and have built an ad-hoc tasks
	scheduler — crontab appeared to be not good enough for us.</p>

	<p>Tech: <strong>Java</strong>, Linux, Apache JServ, XSLT, Oracle 8, Java RMI</p>
