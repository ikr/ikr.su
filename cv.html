	<p>My name is <strong>Ivan Krechetov</strong>. I was born on November 16, <strong>1979</strong>, in Novosibirsk, <strong>Russia</strong>. I
	live in Winterthur, <strong>Switzerland</strong>, with my family: a wife and two children.</p>

	<p>Before I was 11 I didn’t even care if computers exist. Then, one day I randomly stumbled upon a book
	about BASIC, the programming language. <em>And then it began…</em> I was totally blown away by the idea
	that I could create my own worlds in code. I was eager to build smart, beautiful things, which are
	able to make their own decisions, and be… alive, sort of.</p>

	<p>For several years it was a constant creativity bliss: all those small programs and games I made and
	never really finished — because new shiny ideas appeared faster than I could code.</p>

	<p>Since the very beginning I had no doubts at all that I&#8217;ll be coding all my life.</p>
