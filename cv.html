	<p>My name is <strong>Ivan Krechetov</strong>. I was born in <strong>1979</strong>, in Novosibirsk, <strong>Russia</strong>. I live in
	Winterthur, <strong>Switzerland</strong>, with my family: a wife and two daughters.</p>

	<h2 id="early_years">Early years</h2>

	<p>Before I was 11 I didn’t even care if computers exist. Then, one day I randomly stumbled upon a book
	about BASIC, the programming language. <em>And then it began…</em> I was totally blown away by the idea
	that I could create my own worlds in code. I was eager to build smart, beautiful things, which are
	able to make their own decisions, and be… alive, sort of.</p>

	<p>It was a constant creativity bliss: all those small programs and games I made and hardly ever really
	finished — because I was only 12, and because new shiny ideas appeared faster than I could code.
	Since the very beginning I had no doubts at all that I&#8217;ll be coding all my life.</p>

	<h2 id="education">Education</h2>

	<h3 id="19962001">1996–2001</h3>

	<p>I&#8217;ve obtained a <strong>Bachelor&#8217;s degree</strong> from <a href="http://www.nsu.ru">Novosibirsk State University</a> (NSU),
	having graduated with honors, with <strong>100% excellent</strong> grades in the Diploma, which makes me <strong>one of
	the top-2% students</strong>.</p>

	<p>I studied at the department of mechanics and mathematics. We had <em>a lot</em> of Math: mathematical
	analysis, theory of functions of a complex variable, abstract algebra, computation methods, discrete
	mathematics, you name it. Basically, the curriculum was: all the Math imaginable + gym class.</p>

	<p>In the last two years I was doing a research at the chair of programming. My qualification work
	subject was “Forming the object-oriented data structures tailor-made for the search tasks”. In
	essence that was a rather simplistic exploration of how one would go about building an
	object-oriented database.</p>

	<h3 id="20012003">2001–2003</h3>

	<p>I continued at NSU, the same department and chair, and obtained a <strong>Master&#8217;s degree</strong>, again
	<strong>with honors</strong>; however, the grades weren&#8217;t that maxed-out anymore, as I already had in parallel a
	full-time job. My master&#8217;s thesis subject was: “Effective RDBMS usage in an object-oriented
	application”.</p>

	<h3 id="october_2005october_2006">October 2005–October 2006</h3>

	<p>I worked as a PhD Associate at the <a href="http://trese.cs.utwente.nl/">University of Twente</a> in Enschede,
	The Netherlands. My subject was: “Aspectual Refactoring of Software Architectures”, research in the
	field of aspect-oriented software development: separation of concerns, architectural aspects,̱
	architectural styles, software architecture design process, “formal” evaluation and refactoring.</p>
