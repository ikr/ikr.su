# Curriculum vitæ

My name is **Ivan Krechetov**. I was born in **1979**, in Novosibirsk, **Russia**. I live in
Winterthur, **Switzerland**, with my family: a wife and two daughters.

## Early years

Before I was 11 I didn’t even care if computers exist. Then, one day I randomly stumbled upon a book
about BASIC, the programming language. _And then it began…_ I was totally blown away by the idea
that I could create my own worlds in code. I was eager to build smart, beautiful things, which are
able to make their own decisions, and be… alive, sort of.

It was a constant creativity bliss: all those small programs and games I made and hardly ever really
finished — because I was only 12, and because new shiny ideas appeared faster than I could code.
Since the very beginning I had no doubts at all that I'll be coding all my life.

## Education

### 1996–2001

I've obtained a **Bachelor's degree** from [Novosibirsk State University](http://www.nsu.ru) (NSU),
having graduated with honors, with **100% excellent** grades in the diploma, which makes me **one of
the top-2% students**.

I studied at the department of mechanics and mathematics. We had _a lot_ of Math: mathematical
analysis, theory of functions of a complex variable, abstract algebra, computation methods, discrete
mathematics, you name it. Basically, the curriculum was: all the Math imaginable + gym class.

In the last two years I was doing a research at the chair of programming. My qualification work
subject was “Forming the object-oriented data structures tailor-made for the search tasks”. In
essence that was a rather simplistic exploration of how one would go about building an
object-oriented database.

### 2001–2003

I continued at NSU, the same department and chair, and obtained a **Master's degree**, again
**with honors**; however, the grades weren't that maxed-out anymore, as I already had in parallel a
full-time job. My master's thesis subject was: “Effective RDBMS usage in an object-oriented
application”.

### October 2005–October 2006

I worked as a PhD Associate at the [University of Twente](http://trese.cs.utwente.nl/) in Enschede,
The Netherlands. My subject was: “Aspectual Refactoring of Software Architectures”, research in the
field of aspect-oriented software development: separation of concerns, architectural aspects,̱
architectural styles, software architecture design process, “formal” evaluation and refactoring.
