# Curriculum vitæ

My name is **Ivan Krechetov**. I was born on November 16, **1979**, in Novosibirsk, **Russia**. I
live in Winterthur, **Switzerland**, with my family: a wife and two children.

## Early years

Before I was 11 I didn’t even care if computers exist. Then, one day I randomly stumbled upon a book
about BASIC, the programming language. _And then it began…_ I was totally blown away by the idea
that I could create my own worlds in code. I was eager to build smart, beautiful things, which are
able to make their own decisions, and be… alive, sort of.

For several years it was a constant creativity bliss: all those small programs and games I made and
never really finished — because new shiny ideas appeared faster than I could code.

Since the very beginning I had no doubts at all that I'll be coding all my life.
